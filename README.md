# Data Analyst Project : Business Decision Research

<br>Business Problem:
<br>DQLab Sport Center is a shop that sells various sports needs such as Jackets, Clothes, Bags, and Shoes.
<br>This shop started selling in 2013, so it has had regular customers for a long time and is still trying to get newcustomers to this day.
<br>In early 2019, the store manager recruited a Junior Data Analyst to help solve the problem at his store, namely the decline in customers who returned to his store. The Junior Data Analyst was also entrusted with
processing the store's transaction data. 
<br>
<br>The store manager defines that a customer is no longer called a customer (churn) when they have not transacted to his store again up to the last 6 months from thelast available data update.
<br>
<br>The store manager also provided transaction data from 2013 to 2019 in the form of CSV (comma-separated
value) with data_retail.csv with 100,000 rows of data.
<br>
<br>
<br>Solution Problem:
<br>•	Analyzed Customer Churn to increase customer purchase, transaction and revenue
<br>•	Analyzed Customer Churn Prediction based on Transaction Count, Average Transaction Amount and Year Difference based on Last Year Transaction and First Year Transaction with Logistic Regression Algorithm
